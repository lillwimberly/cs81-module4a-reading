The functions and variable had clear and descriptive names. I also appreciated having the object data at the top of the page so I could use it to understand how these functions were mutating and accessing the data.
Understanding the structure of objects nesting within array is difficult. In addition, recognizing the format required for iterating over the different values is hard to keep track of.
